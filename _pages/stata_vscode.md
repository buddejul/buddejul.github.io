A guide that describes how to use Stata in VS Code.

# Setup
First download and install the latest version of VS Code.

## (Stata) Extensions
One of the great things about VS Code are user contributed extensions. 
There are few - though not many - useful VS Code extensions for Stata as well. These allow to (a) use Stata syntax highlighting and (b) run Stata 
Furthermore, it is possible to prepare blank code snippets for Stata specific uses (more on the see below).

In general, to install extensions click on the Extensions icon in the VS Code sidebar (the one with the three + one blocks).
### Stata Enhanced
Provided by Kyle Barron, Stata Enhanced provides "syntax highlighting in Visual Studio Code, built from the ground up".
The extension highlights almost everything in a nice and readable manner.
